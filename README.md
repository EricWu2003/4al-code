# 4al-code
My physics 4al lab class requires us to use a bluetooth module to stream collected data to computers.

The bluetooth modules are unreliable and difficult to connect. We end up wasting a lot of time messing with bluetooth.

This repository contains some code that instead stores collected data into the arudino's EEPROM, and then reads it back later. This allows me to get around using the bluetooth module.
